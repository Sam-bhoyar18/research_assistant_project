# research_assistant_project
The project is called “Smart Research Assistant”. It’s built using Spring Boot (a Java-based backend framework) together with Spring AI (for AI-related features).
The core idea: it’s a tool intended to help users with research tasks — likely to assist in organizing, generating or summarizing research content, helping manage references, automate parts of research workflows, or generate drafts, using AI + backend infrastructure.
